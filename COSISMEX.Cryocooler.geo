#File defines the mechanical cryocooler, copper supports, and aluminum Cryostat_Cooler_Box (referred to colloquially as the "doghouse")

###Alex originally made a simple model of the cryocooler in 2012 (?), and he chose the inner radius of CryocoolerBody such that the total mass of the cryostat was 3.1 kg (mass without the collar, bellows or copper supports from the cryocooler manual). I've done the same here.

###Due to the TUBS shape, I thought it would be easier to draw the cryocooler so that z would be along the axis of rotation of the pump. - its +1.116cm off of the center axis of the BRIK

###Because I am uncreative, I've just used the term "CryocoolerBody_#" to represent the different sections of the cooler that are permenantly attached. The numbers increase working from the main body up to the tip.

##I had this part wrong, cause I had the cryocooler tip going into the doghouse - so there were obviously overlaps there. Using the new geomega geomeotry overlap checker, i foudn that this pieve was 3.11 cm into the doghouse, so I just cut it that much shorter

###The Cryocooler_Support* are those designed by Chris Smith, composed mostly of smashed together thin copper sheets. I've just modeled them as BRIKs of copper with the correct width and height.

### Cryostat_Cooler_Box is the "doghouse". The aluminum extension to the cryostat within which the cryocooler tip is located.
